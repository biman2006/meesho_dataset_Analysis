SQL data analysis on an e-commerce dataset(meesho) to explore orders, revenue, and order outcomes.

# 📊 SQL Data Analysis on E-commerce Orders
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce order dataset using SQL to extract meaningful insights related to order trends, revenue, cancellations, and logistics performance.

🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset contains order-level information with the following columns:

order_date

sub_order_num

order_status

state

pin

price

meesho_price

gst_amount

shipping_charges_total

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

SQL (MySQL / SQLite syntax)

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Total number of orders and unique states

State-wise order distribution

Top states by number of orders and revenue

Average order value analysis

Order status breakdown (Delivered, Shipped, Cancelled, Return, RTO)

Percentage of failed orders (Cancelled + Return + RTO)

Total revenue and total shipping cost

State and PIN-level revenue analysis

## 📈 Visualizations

Bar charts for state-wise orders and revenue

Pie chart for order outcome percentage

Comparative plots for business insights

## 🧠 Key Insights

A small percentage of orders fall under failed categories such as Cancelled, Return, and RTO.

Certain states contribute significantly higher order volumes and revenue.

Shipping costs and order outcomes play an important role in operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I improved my ability to:

Write analytical SQL queries using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE WHEN, and aggregation functions

Perform data cleaning and business-oriented analysis

Convert SQL outputs into clear visual insights
